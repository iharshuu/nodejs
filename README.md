# My First Express.js Backend with MongoDB and Mongoose

Welcome to my first backend project built using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose! This project showcases my journey into building a RESTful API with Node.js and is aimed at providing an introduction to backend development. Here's what you can find in this repository:

## Features

- **Express.js**: Utilized Express.js to create a robust and efficient RESTful API server.

- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Leveraged MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for interacting with the database.

- **Data Validation**: Integrated the Express-validator middleware to validate data before processing it, ensuring the integrity of the data.

- **Timestamps**: Implemented timestamps for each document to track when it was created and last updated.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:


1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection in `config.js`.
3. Run the server: `npm start`
4. Start making requests to the API endpoints!

## API Endpoints

Here are some of the main API endpoints available in this project:

- `GET /api/v1/users`: Fetch all users.
- `POST /api/v1/users/add`: Create a new user.
- `PUT /api/v1/users/update/:id`: Update user information.
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/delete/:id`: Delete a user.

Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and create a pull request if you have any improvements or fixes to share.
